usage:

./fractol [fractal] [color] [iter:<iterations>]

--> Everything besides the program name is optional and will default safely.

usage julia:

./fractol julia [color] [iter:<iterations>] [j_real_num:<number.1f>] [j_imag_num:<number.1f>]
./fractol julia rainbow iter:100 j_real_num:0.2 j_imag_num:0.8

--> arguments starting with j_ are exclusive to the julia set
	--> these have to be passed after the fractal name

fractals:
- [mandelbrot] based on formula: z = z^2 + c
- [julia] based on formula: z = z^2 + c with a constant c
- [burning_ship] based on formula: z = |Re(z)| + i|Im(z)| + c

color schemes:
- [rainbow] without any color shifts
- [ultra_fractal] blue gradient
- [shift] with color shifts based on zoom

iterations:
- iter:[number] number of iterations to calculate the fractal
(must be a positive integer)
- lots of iterations can significantly impact performance

example:
"./fractol" defaults to

./fractol mandelbrot rainbow iter:30
