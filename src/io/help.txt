usage:

./fractol [fractal] [color scheme] iter:[iterations]

--> Everything besides the program name is optional and will default safely.

usage julia:

./fractol julia rainbow iter:100 j_real_num:0.285 j_imag_num:0.01

--> arguments starting with j_ are exclusive to the julia set
	--> these have to be passed after the fractal name

fractals:
- mandelbrot based on formula: z = z^2 + c
- julia based on formula: z = z^2 + c with a constant c
- burning_ship based on formula: z = |Re(z)| + i|Im(z)| + c

color schemes:
- rainbow rainbow color scheme
- blue_gradient based on ultra fractal's blue gradient

iterations:
- iter:[number] number of iterations to calculate the fractal 
(must be a positive integer)
- lots of iterations can significantly impact performance

example:
"./fractol" defaults to

./fractol mandelbrot rainbow iter:30
